        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Kelsey Beffel. I grew up in a beautiful little house in San Francisco with my parents, older
            brother,
            and twin sister. San Francisco was my playground until I moved to Seattle to go to college in 2010. My degree is in
            Busienss Economics with a Spanish minor from Seattle University.</p>
        <p>After graduating I became an underwriter at Liberty Mutual. In 2017 I was aceped into a Liberty run program
            for
            employees outside of Commercial Technology to transition into software developer positions. Currently I am an
            associate software developer at Liberty Mutual.</p>
